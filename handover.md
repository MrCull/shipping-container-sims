| Ticket | Title | Blocked by | Status | Claimed by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #221 | profile the 0.5 peak day, wall time and throughput (measure only, 30 min) | none | claimed | agent |
| #222 | final: scale 1 or best scale, goldens, smoke | #221 and the tickets it proposes | blocked | |

Tickets for the top causes are added under #220 after #221 reports.

## Small tickets beside #220 (decided 2026-11-03)

| Ticket | Title | Budget | Status | Claimed by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #223 | bay view: ROB cells always grey (#168), closes #192 | 10 min | claimed | agent |
| #191 | x3600 spec: functional check stays, 600 floor moves to an @load spec | 10 min | to do | |
| #218 | prove each room-rising path unparks an SHC job (test-only) | 15 min | to do | |
| #224 | measure SMOKE_WORKERS=2 on the dev suite (heavy runs: start after #221 ends) | 15 min | to do | |

Standing rule: merge a PR I opened when CI is green and the review has no blocking finding, then fast-forward and start the next work.
